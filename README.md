4. **Download YOLOv8 Models**
The project uses YOLOv8 models for vehicle detection. Models are automatically downloaded on first use, or manually download:
```bash
# Download nano model (smallest, fastest)
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('yolov8n.pt')"

# Download medium model (balanced)
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; YOLO('yolov8m.pt')"
```

5. **Database Setup**
```bash
cd c:\Users\maner\Downloads\SmartSlot\myenv\Smart-car-parking
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python populate_sample_data.py  # Optional: Load sample data
```

6. **Run Development Server**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:8000`
